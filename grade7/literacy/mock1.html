                        <h4>THE SECRET OF LONG LIFE</h4>
                        <p>Munene had just celebrated his 114th birthday. Reporters visited him in his remote village in Shangombo, Western Province to find out the secret of long life.</p>
                        <p>"The secret of long life," Munene said, "is happiness. If you are happy, you will live a long time."</p>
                        <p>"Are you married?" a reporter asked.</p>
                        <p>"Yes," Munene replied. "I married my third wife when I was 102 years old. If you are happily married, you live forever. If it had not been for my third wife, I would have died years ago."</p>
                        <p>"What about smoking and drinking?" a reporter asked.</p>
                        <p>"Yes, they are important", Munene said. "Don't smoke at all and you will feel well,</p>
                        <p>Drink two glasses of wine a day and you will be healthy and happy,"</p>
                        <p>"If you could live your life again, what would you do?" the reporter asked.</p>
                        <p>"I would do what I have done. If I had had more sense, I would eat more yoghourt!" he laughed.</p>
                        <p>"Supposing you could change one thing in your life, what would you change?" another reporter asked.</p>
                        <p>"Not much," Munene replied.</p>
                        <p>"So, you don’t have any regrets?"</p>
                        <p>"Yes, I have one regret," Munene replied. "If I had known that I was going to live so long, I would have looked after myself </p>

                        <h4>TEXT 2</h4>
                        <p>When Sipho came to my class, he was nearly seven years old. Within two weeks of starting school, he was already proving to be difficult in class. He was playful, often teased other children and disturbed them in class. He refused to write anything and always lost his pencils.</p>
                        <p>One day, he was sitting on the carpet with the rest of the class. I asked some children in the class to tell me their news. Sipho wanted to talk but I did not let him have a turn that day. At the end of the session, everybody had to go back to their desks and draw a picture of some news. Sipho refused to return to his desk. </p>
                        <p>When I repeated my instruction, he pretended that he did not understand me. When I went over to him to lead him back to his seat, he ran away, racing through the class laughing at me. I got very angry and told him to be back in his seat by the count of three. I counted to three but he was still running around laughing.</p>
                        <p>Although I was angry, I did not want to hit him. However, I felt degraded at the thought of chasing Sipho in front of all other children. All these feelings made me react in a personal way. The next time Sipho came close to me, I grabbed him and pushed him out of the classroom. Once Sipho was outside, I closed the door. He made a lot of noise such that everybody in the school knew what was going on.</p>
                        <p>Eventually, the headteacher came around and asked what had happened. She then took Sipho to her office and spoke to him, trying to find out why he was so troublesome, In the end, Sipho had to apologise to me before he was allowed back into my class. I was so grateful that the headteacher was so supportive, but deep inside I felt like a failure.</p>

So, Sipho asked his friend to give him one cigarette so that he could feel the way people who smoke tobacco feel. His friend gave him one cigarette. He took a puff and started coughing. After a few minutes, Sipho started running around the school shouting and chasing other learners. Then, he started to feel dizzy and sick.</p>
                        <p>The teacher came in and asked him what was wrong. He could not tell him because he was feeling dizzy and was panting. The teacher took Sipho to the clinic. At the clinic the nurse examined him and told the teacher that he had smoked dagga. The following day, he felt better. He told himself never to smoke tobacco nor dagga because it made him feel sick.</p>
